# Titanic Dataset EDA

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset, using Python libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. The goal of this project is to explore the Titanic dataset by analyzing various patterns, distributions, and correlations between features, as well as uncovering insights about the passengers' survival rates and other characteristics.

## Key Steps:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Data visualization to uncover trends and patterns
- Statistical analysis and feature exploration

## Libraries Used:
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook

## How to Run the Code:
